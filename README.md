# ASAP Bookings
A platform that allows users to schedule appointments with their favourite restaurants and minimize waiting time by increasing the efficiency of the process. We aim to minimize the scope of spreading COVID-19 by decreasing the gathering of people in lineups for both Dine-In and Takeout orders.
